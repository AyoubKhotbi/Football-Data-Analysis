# Football-Data-Analysis

Wyscout-based functions help you define how a football team can score during a match.
They are not fully working, you can only find about 80% of the goals in a season and goals may not be categorized right.

The idea is to split up these kind of goals in 10 categories:

1)Penalty  --> find every penalty goal;
2)Free Kick Shot --> find every goal made by direct free kick shot;
3)Indirect Free Kick Shot --> find every goal made by indirect free kick shot
4)Throw in Shot --> find all the goals born from a throw in
5)Ball Recovery --> find all the goals born from a ball recovery, dividing it in 'Counter Attack Shot' and 'Ball Recovery Shot'
6)positional_attacks -->
7)corner_kick_schema --> find every corner 
8)direct_corner_kick -->
9)Own goal --> find all own goals
10)Goalkeeper's bounce --> find all the goal born from a failed save by the goalkeeper, who put the ball back into the field
